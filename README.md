Our protagonist **Juniper** lives in a **post-apocalyptic world** where there isn't much greenery left and pollution has taken over. On a walk, she **stumbles upon a potato plant** and goes on a **journey to deliver it to a seed bank** where it will be kept safe. Juniper **discovers many more plants** outside the city for the first time in her lifetime, giving her a fresh colorful start. **You can find the link to the submission on** [itch.io - Buddy Up Jam](https://itch.io/jam/buddy-up-jam/rate/1244168).
