      Dear Child,

      You are on your
      way. You should now be outside of town. All you have to do is cross the plains
      towards the tallest building of the city. Remember my old office?


      Ha,
      that also reminds of the afternoon walks we took here along the forest and
      up the mountains. You were so quiet when we moved here. I can''t even imagine
      what you must have been going through. I was so busy with my own grief, that
      I forgot how much you needed me. I am sorry I was not there for you. And I
      am sorry that I took away the little memories you still had of your mother
      when we moved here. I wish I could turn back time. Take you out on more hikes,
      show you the world, and teach you how to enjoy the little things again, step
      by step, just like your mother loved them. She would have been proud, seeing
      the young woman you have become.


      But there is still time. I will make
      it right.


      Love,

      Your Dad'

      Dear Child,

      It is worth than
      I thought. The bridge has collapsed and the only way into the city is through
      the sewers below. I hope you remembered and could find the entrance.


      I
      don''t know what I was thinking taking you down here with me. This was a great
      place to research the possibilities of growing plants underground. Study their
      resilience and the best strains. You were so excited when you could help me
      tend to the plants. I still chuckle when I think about your first instinct
      to just try to eat everything. I hope you still kept your curiosity. I was
      disappointed when you told me you are going to study floral design. You could
      have done so much more with your life.


      But I get it now, you wanted
      to be close to her. Be like her. And I am sure you are amazing at it. I hope
      one day we can brighten our kitchen table with a bouquet made by you out of
      flowers we planted together.


      Love,

      Your Dad'

      Dear Child,

      The Seed Vault is
      just ahead. But the way through the courtyard is blocked..


      Remember
      the time we got stuck in this elevator? It was one of those days where I decided
      to come into the office instead of spending time at home with you. We had the
      great power outage. A first sign of the upcoming disaster but as with so many
      things back then we decided to ignore the warnings.


      You were so scared
      but I explained to you why elevators are safe even if there is no power. It
      took them almost 4 hours to get us out of there. But what I remember the most
      is, that it was the first time you opened up to me. You said " Daddy, I know
      you are trying your best. I love you."


      I love you, too, kiddo!

      Your
      Dad'
