    entryDescription: "Summer 24 A.C. (after cataclysm)\r\n\r\nDear Child,\r\nI was
      hoping you would make it before the storm hit. I\u2019d stayed if I could,
      but they dragged me out into one of the shelters. It scares me to think that
      you have been out there all alone. The storm here lasted for days and when
      it was finally over, nothing was like before. We kept moving from camp to camp,
      but it is finally safe enough again, that I dare venture out to the place we
      agreed to meet in case we should lose each other. Remember the place? We spent
      almost all your birthdays there.\r\n\r\nInternet and phones won\u2019t work
      anymore, but here is a map of landmarks to follow to make it there.\r\n\r\nWe
      will use the seed vaults to regrow what has been lost. I can't wait to see
      you there!\r\n\r\nLove,\r\nYour Dad"
